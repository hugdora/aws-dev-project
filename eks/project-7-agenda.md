  - In app settings, go to **Incoming Webhooks** in the left sidebar
  - Toggle **Activate Incoming Webhooks** to **On**
- **Add a Webhook to a Channel:**
  - Click **Add New Webhook to Workspace**
  - Select the channel for deployment notifications
  - Click **Allow**
- **Copy the Webhook URL:**
  -SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your-slack-webhook-url
  - Store it securely (treat it like a secret)

---

## 9️⃣ Configure GitHub Repository Secrets

**Objective:** Store sensitive credentials securely in GitHub.

- Navigate to workflow repository on GitHub
- Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
- Add the following repository secrets:

| Secret Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | AWS access key for deployment |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS secret key for deployment |
| `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` | GitHub PAT for repository access |
| `RDS_DB_PASSWORD` | Database password for RDS |
| `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | Private key for modules repository access |

- Verify all secrets are added

---

## 🔟 Organize Build Scripts

**Objective:** Restructure scripts for manual and automated workflows.

- Create `manual` folder in docker scripts directory
- Move existing manual build and push scripts to `manual` folder
- Verify manual scripts still work when needed

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Create Pipeline Build and Push Scripts

**Objective:** Create automated scripts for CI/CD pipeline.

**Build Image Script:**
- Create `build-image.sh` for pipeline use
- Configure script to:
  - Accept environment variables (`DOMAIN_NAME`, `RDS_ENDPOINT`, `RDS_DB_PASSWORD`, `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`)
  - Build Docker image with appropriate tags
- Make script executable

**Push Image Script:**
- Create `push-image.sh` for pipeline use
- Configure script to:
  - Authenticate with Amazon ECR
  - Tag Docker image with ECR repository URI
  - Push image to ECR repository
- Make script executable

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Create GitHub Actions Workflow File

**Objective:** Define the complete CI/CD pipeline configuration.

**Workflow Configuration:**
